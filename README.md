 <li>Let A be a matrix such that the entries in each row add up to 1. Show that the vector with all entries qual to 1 is an eigenvector. What is the corresponding eigenvalue?</li>

 <li>For an <em>n </em>× <em>n </em>matrix <em>A </em>prove that:

  <ul>

   <li>If <em>λ </em>is an eigenvalue, <em>u </em>a corresponding eigenvector <em>c </em>a scalar, then <em>λ</em>+<em>c </em>is an eigenvalue of <em>A</em>+<em>cI </em>and <em>u </em>is a corresponding eigenvector.</li>

   <li>If the entries of each row of <em>A </em>add up to 0, then 0 is an eigenvalue, and thus the matrix is not invertible.</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>Let <em>Q </em>be a unitary matrix and <em>λ </em>be an eigenvalue of <em>Q</em>, prove that |<em>λ</em>| =1.</li>
